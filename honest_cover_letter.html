<h3>Honest Cover Letter</h3>

<p>Hey there,</p>
<p>This opportunity looks too good to be true. Instead of teaching myself how to program for hours each evening I can get paid to learn?</p>
<p>You have got to hire me. First off, I am a genius. Don’t believe me? Well all I have to do is pay my annual dues and I will be a member of MENSA again. Not to mention four days a week I find a way to make statistics interesting to a bunch of late teens and early twenty-somethings who really don’t want to be there.</p>
<p>So yes, I’m old. But isn’t everybody up there in D.C. always talking about how we need to retrain mid-career workers to code? Well here I am. Plus I am past the party stage so I won’t be coming into work hungover and I can actually concentrate on the task at hand.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I’m really cool. I have a dog and an SUV (Ford Escape, 2012). I play the guitar (pretty well but I’m out of practice) and I speak Spanish (really well and I practice a lot). And all the women seem to love my red hair.</p>
<p>And I really do work hard. I have been accepted to a Ph.D. in finance starting this fall and I also own a business selling fashion accessories in South America, both of which give me ulcers to think about. But I'm still just lazy enough to be a good programmer.</p>
<p>Anyway, let me know if I might be a fit. If not I’ll just keep on doing what I’m doing. But just remember, when I make it big I will definitely remember my friends!</p>
<p>So, in summary:
	 <ul>
	 	<li>MENSA</li>
	 	<li>Dog</li>
		<li>SUV</li>
	 	<li>Guitar</li>
		<li>Spanish</li>
		<li>Friends</li>
		<li>Did this myself in less than an hour</li>
	 </ul></p>
<p>Later,</p>
<p>Ben</p>
